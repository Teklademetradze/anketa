    <h1 style="text-align: center;color:black;"> Måneskin </h1>
   
    <p style= "color:white;background-color: black; border:4px solid red">Måneskin (Danish: [ˈmɔːnəˌske̝nˀ];[1] Danish for 'moonlight') are an Italian rock band formed in Rome in 2016. The band is composed of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio.[2] Performing in the streets in their early days, they rose to prominence after finishing second in the eleventh season of the Italian talent show X Factor in 2017. Their international breakthrough ensued when the foursome won the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 for Italy with the song "Zitti e buoni".

        The band have released two studio albums Il ballo della vita (2018) and Teatro d'ira: Vol. I (2021), one extended-play, and ten singles, which have topped the Italian and European music charts. They have collected 28 platinum and 7 gold certifications from FIMI (Federation of the Italian Music Industry),[3] and have sold over one million records in Italy before their post-Eurovision breakthrough.[4] In 2021, Måneskin became the first Italian rock band to reach the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, with their songs "Zitti e buoni", "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and their cover of The Four Seasons's "Beggin'" reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, collecting multiple international recording certifications.</p>
